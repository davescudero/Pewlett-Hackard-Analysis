## Summary

### *Silver Tsunami*

The *silver tsunami* is how we call at the upcoming generational change at PH.
Looking at the analysis we can see that there are **only 1,550** employees eleigible for the potential openings at PH, and there up to **90,396 vacancies**, that means that the criteria used for the Mentorship Program need to be modified in order to be a thriving progrma for the company.
I recommend to wide the criteria for the elibility at the program, so more employees has the chance to fill those positions, and not to search for new people for the company, which may cost more money.
